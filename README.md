# JS-Events-Calendar
rebuilt a PHP calendar in JavaScript and jQuery. It's a quick and dirty example, but it does what I need it to do.

Use it however you like.

I generally populate my calendar with items from a database.  I tried to provide as much of a starting framework for pulling items in from a db and outputting to the calendar.
